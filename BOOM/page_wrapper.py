# page wraper: wrap around every response to control the base page. Ex: the user action button.
# or we could use javascript to see if there are user-id cookie so we don't have to render the page on our server.
# experiment: write a cookie with server, check if there are user_id cookie in response, and then change the document content
# with DOM.
